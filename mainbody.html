  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <h3>Why IT?</h3>

  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</h3>
  <p>When I decided to study in Bachelor of Information Technology, I considered few things to choose the university I like. 
Firstly, it must a top of university in Melbourne and close my home. 
Secondly, it has online study course as I am a single mother, I must work full time to keep my family running normally in the first two years.
Lastly, it has strength in Computer Science or Information Technology.
Based on that information, I chose RMIT--Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is one of the top public research universities in Melbourne. RMIT is ranked 190th in Quacquarelli Symonds 2023 and 244th globally in Best Global Universities 2022. The main campus of RMIT is situated on the northern edge of the historic Hoddle Grid in the city center of Melbourne. The buildings of RMIT are very famous in Melbourne city, and they all look like a beautiful artwork. I went to RMIT buildings and took a lot of photos when I first time arrived in Melbourne in 2012 like the other tourers. City campus is close to my home than Monash or La Trobe. I only need to take one line of train to campus. RMIT provides online course for Bachelor of Information Technology. RMIT is ranked in the world’s top 100 universities for computer science and information systems. 
Now, I already started RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology Course, I felt very good, and I have confidence that I will be successful in this as I really like the teaching strategy of RMIT.

<h3>What I expect?</h3>
<p>
I studied a python course on Udemy for a while before studying this course. I felt like I really like the logic thinking in the coding procedure. I love the feelings after you solve the difficult problem. I desired to become a software engineer to achieve my own purpose. I hope I can learn how to do program properly and learn more popular tools that applied in computer science. Build up a form fundamental for my future study. Learn how to improve work efficiency and improve team collaborate skills.
